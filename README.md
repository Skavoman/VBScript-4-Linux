-----------------------------------------------------------------

**VBScript-4-Linux** is a Java Swing based application that uses [Wine](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine) to let you create, write and run 
VBScript files while on Linux operating systems. This application comes packaged with Windows ScriptHost executables [Wscript.exe](https://archive.org/details/wscript_202506) 
and [Cscript.exe](https://archive.org/details/cscript_202506), which are also included in the source-code. VBS4L is incredibly simple, but it does what it is advertised to do, and almost nothing else. 
VBS4L is also open source, so feel free to do whatever with it. 

Written in Temurin OpenJDK version 21.0.7
