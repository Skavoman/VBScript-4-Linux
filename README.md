-----------------------------------------------------------------

**VBScript-4-Linux** is a Java Swing based application that uses [Wine](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine) to let you create, write and run 
VBScript files while on Linux operating systems. This application comes packaged with a copy of a Windows Scripting Host executable, [Wscript.exe](https://archive.org/details/wscript_202506), 
which is also included in the source-code. VBS4L is incredibly simple, but it does what it is advertised to do,,and literally nothing else. 
VBS4L is also open source, so feel free to do whatever with it. 

Written in Temurin OpenJDK version 21.0.7 in Apache Netbeans 26.
Wscript.exe version 5.812.
