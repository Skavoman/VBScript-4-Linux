-----------------------------------------------------------------

**VBScript-4-Linux** is a Java Swing based application that uses [Wine](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine) and [xterm](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/) 
(make sure you have both installed!) to help you create, write and run VBScript files while on Linux operating systems. This application comes packaged with 
Windows Script Host executables [wscript.exe](https://archive.org/details/wscript_202506) and [cscript.exe](https://archive.org/details/cscript_202506), 
which are also included in the source-code. VBS4L is incredibly simple, but it does what it is advertised to do, and almost nothing else.VBS4L is also open source, 
so feel free to do whatever with it. 

Written in Temurin OpenJDK version 21.0.7
Windows Script Host version 5.812.
