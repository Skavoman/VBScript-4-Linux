----------------------------------------------

**VBScript-4-Linux** is a text editing tool written in Java that will let you write and run VBS files on Linux using Wine. 
It's very simple (Very Basic Shit 4 Linux), but it does what it is advertised to do, but literally nothing else-- yet. 
It's open source, so have fun with it.
